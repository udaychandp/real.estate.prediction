# real.estate.prediction
This is a project where you can sort undervalued properties with their per_sq_mtr value basically you can assign the threshold and classify the value based on the your own Budget

> Overview of this Project

I leverage data sourced from Magicbricks, a renowned platform for property listings. Through systematic data extraction and analysis, I gather essential information such as plot prices, sizes, and the number of bedrooms (BHK). Employing predictive modeling techniques, I aim to identify undervalued plots within the dataset. The criteria for determining undervalued properties involve intricate considerations, with one significant factor being the price per square foot. By establishing a threshold based on comprehensive market insights, the algorithm assesses each plot's pricing against its size, enabling it to pinpoint those properties that exhibit potential undervaluation. This predictive approach allows for a nuanced understanding of the real estate market, providing valuable insights to investors, developers, and homebuyers seeking lucrative opportunities in the ever-evolving property landscape.
